            <p id="relative-box" class="paragraph">After a stint working in NYC radio (writing comedy bits/parodies, producing a morning show, and doing crank calls for over 250 stations),
            Gene made the next logical move and spent the next 18 years of his life in the glamorous world of graduate school test preparation.
            First as a teacher and content developer, then as a manager, Gene specialized in all the ins and outs and what-have-yous of the
            LSAT (for law school), GMAT (for business school), and GRE (general graduate school).  Now Gene has added to his repertorire by building
            websites through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
